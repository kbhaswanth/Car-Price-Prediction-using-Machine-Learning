# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Project Description:

In today’s rapidly growing automobile market, determining the accurate resale value of a used car is a major challenge due to various factors influencing the price, such as brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, mileage, engine capacity, transmission, and ownership history. The Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the fair market value of a car based on its key features.

This project uses a dataset containing detailed information about cars — including attributes like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine power, and number of seats — to train various machine learning algorithms. Models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree, and XGBoost are evaluated to identify the best-performing one based on accuracy metrics such as R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

By analyzing these factors, the system helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions regarding the valuation of used cars, ensuring transparency and fairness in pricing.

# Objectives:

To analyze and preprocess the dataset for model training.

To identify the key features that influence car prices.

To build and compare different machine learning models for prediction.

To develop a reliable model with high accuracy for real-world use.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

# Methodology:

Data Collection:
Gathered dataset containing car attributes (e.g., brand, model, year, mileage, etc.).

Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, performed label encoding for categorical data, and normalized numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized feature correlations and identified trends affecting car prices.

Model Building:
Trained multiple regression algorithms to predict car prices.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluated models using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score to select the best-performing algorithm.

Deployment (optional):
Integrated the final model into a web application using Flask or Streamlit for user interaction.

# Outcome:

The developed machine learning model successfully predicts car prices with high accuracy. It provides a data-driven approach for estimating used car values, reducing guesswork and helping both sellers and buyers make better financial decisions.

# Applications:

Used car dealerships for price estimation

Online car resale platforms (like OLX, Cars24)

Automobile analytics and valuation services

Customer decision support for fair pricing
